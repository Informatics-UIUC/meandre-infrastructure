1.2vcli Panellet:

* Added MrProbe class. This thread stands during the execution to gather information of the run
	- New class added MrProbe
	- New package org.meandre.core.engine.probes added
		* This package contains different implementations of the probe mechanisms
		* NullProbeImpl discards all the information
		* ToPrintStreamProbreImpl diverts all the info as text to the provided print stream

* Added cacheRefresh to the add/remove location services

* Modified the ComponentContextProperties to provide getFlowID function [Feb 16th 2008 by Amit Kumar]
	-Added the function implementation in ComponentContextImpl/Wrapped*Required/Conductor and WrappedComponents
	- This distinguishes getFlowID/getFlowExecutionID

* Modified the /services/repository/add and /services/repository/add_flow services
	- Added overwrite flag (if true overwrites the component/flow descriptor)
	- Added dump flag (if true dumps the repository after the requested modifications using the same format of requested modifications)

* Modified the ConductorTest to include the Python component.

* Added a Python component to the demo set
	- The component just turns a string to upper case (named To Uppercase)

* Modified the conductor to run embedded Python/Jython components
	- Python scripts are embedded contexts
	- Location should point to the component base URI
	- Multiple contexts (scripts can be attached)
	- There is no guarante about the order of scripts execution

* Passed the embedding test using the upgraded (see updates ExecutableContext) E2K demo components
	- Test demo and traditional context URIs work (Fixed a typo on the connector URI convention)
	- Test with all the embedded components

* (!!) Updated ExecutableContext. This change will break all components so far
	- initialize() changed to initialize(ComponentContextProperties ccp)
	- dispose() changed to dispose(ComponentContextPropoerties ccp)

* Root the ComponentContext in to the root interface ComponentContextProperties
	- ComponentContext presents the same API as before
	- ComponentContextProperties expose the subset of the original API not related to execution

* Created and tested the class JythonExecutableComponentAdapter
	- This class acts as an adapter
	- The adapter translate the ExcecutableComponent interface into it Jython counter part
	- The ComponentContext instance is accessible thanks to the Jython bindings
	- The Jython bindings turn getters/setters into pythonic assignable instance variables

* Created the new package subtree org.meandre.core.environments
	- This package is intended to group all non-java executable components
	- The package org.meandre.core.environments.python contains Python related environments
	- The package org.meandre.core.environments.python.jython contains the adapter to run Jython flavored executable components

* Modified the Conductor to allow embedding:
	- When preparing the URL class loader
	- If context is a resource pass the URI to the class loader
	- If context is a literal the content is dumped to /run/java with an encode name ending in .jar
	- Conductor implements a cache of the already dumped flows to boost up the preparation time (unless the hash code of the literal has changed)

* Modified the Repository beans to deal with RDFNodes
	- Old URI formats to contexts (jars) are expressed as Resources (external contexts)
	- Embeddable contexts (jars) are expressed as Literals
	- RDFNode homogenizes the use of contexts (external or embedded)

* (!!) Patched JENA to allow proper embedding:
	- Added case Text.CLOB to line 2238 in file DriverRDB.java to allow large literals in Derby
	- Hacked the derby.sql definition and replace the tail of the literal table to CLOB to allow long literals

* The add service modified:
	- jar parameter renamed as context
	- Added the embed check button for contexts

* Rework the repository implementation metadata processing
	- Moved from SPARQL prototypes to the equivalent procedural version using JENA API
	- Also used the indexer straight will manual filtering to boost search performance
	- Performance of the repository interaction hugely improved.
	- Remove the SPARQL injection problem on the full text search

* Modified the loggers to work on a rotating scheme
	- ./log dir destination of the loggers

* Added org.meandre.core.utils.vocabulary to contain all metadata relate vocabulary.
	- Add the repository one and patched the RepositoryImpl, ComponentDescriptionImpl, and FlowDescriptionImpl

* Moved the WSCoreBootstrapper from org.meandre in the src-kernel tree to org.meandre.webservices in the src-ws tree

* Main log file splitted:
	- The kernel logging goes to meandre-kerne.log file
	- The demo logging goes to meandre-demo.log file
	- The WS logging goes to meandre-webservices.log file

* WSCoreBootstrapper got moved to org.meandre.webservices.

* Source refactoring. Will broke:
	- ant
	- nbproject

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1vcli Carquinyoli:

* Meandre Core Web Service Execution Engine, Repository, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0vcli Farina:

* Plain all mixed together (engine, web app demo, and basic publishing services)
