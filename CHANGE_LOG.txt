1.3.1cli Xuixo

* Updated Xstream library to 1.3 July 19th 2008

* Added simple formatter for the logger July 19th 2008


1.3.1cli Xuixo

* Changed the software revision string to be of the format ##.##.##

*Added a JMX based probe implementation for tying the component and the flow lifecycle with other applications.
-This functionality allows the engine to send notifications to an embedded JMX server and other 
applications (not running in the same JVM or host as the engine is) to monitor when a new 
Flow starts/ends/aborts and the port number it starts on etc. It also allows the application to check the
status of the components -i.e if a particular component has been fired or not  -or for example if it has
pushedData out of the port or not.  These messages/notifications become useful when I am trying to integrate 
with other applications where we want to be able to inform the user  running a web browser what's going on with 
the Analytics portion of there workflow etc.

* Complementary to the probe is a JMX based client side classes/adapters that external applications can use to 
listen to these events -the code is in src-jmx folder

* Added/Modified three new calls in the execute/* family. 

 The /excute/flow.txt  optionally accepts a parameter called "token" -the value of this token would be any random string 
 generated by the caller a good token could be for example System.currentTimeInMilliseconds().concat(Client's ip adress).
 
 
 A new call which retrieves the flow properties based on this token the call is
 /execute/uri_flow.txt?token=$uniqueTokenPassedInTheCallAbove
 -This returns properties string as show below
 port=1716
 hostname=192.168.0.2
 token=1213938009687
 uri=http://test.org/flow/webmonkflow/1213938147793/1565344277


 A new call that returns the list of webui fragment urls
 execute/web_component_url.txt?uri=$flowInstanceUri for example returns
 http://127.0.0.1:1716/http://www.seasrproject.org/components/monkadaptercomponent/monkadaptercomponent/webmonkflow
 
 Another new call that returns the running port number for a given flow instance.
 /execute/url.txt?uri=$flowInstanceUri for example returns
	http://127.0.0.1:1716/

Which is the address where the flow with instance id as the parameter value for uri is running.
 


1.3vcli Xuixo

* Fix to the MAU executor to only use the jars contained on it.

* (!!) Modified the demo components' URIs to follow the same convention. This
       may brake previous flows relying on the demo components. Also modified the
       ZigZag test files to reflect the change.

* Zigzag interpreter improved instance reflection information (now also shows component relation)

* ZigZag interpreter adding functionality to the console
	- show: Shows the flow built so far.

* ZigZag interpreter adding functionality to the console
	- license: Prints the University of Illinois/NCSA open source license.
	
* Added an ant script. It provides the following tasks:

	- compile
	- compile-tests
	- clean
	- run-tests
	- test-reports
	- javadoc
	- dist
	
	You should not run the Meandre server there. The dist task generates 4 standalone jars:
	
	- meandre-server-X.Y.jar (Meandre server)
	- zz-X.Y.jar (The ZigZag interpreter conole)
	- zzc-X.Y.jar (The ZigZag compiler)
	- zzre-X.Y.jar (The ZigZag runtime for MAU files)

* ZigZag interpreter adding functionality to the console
	- run     : Runs the current flow if possible
	
* ZigZag interpreter console providing the following system command
	 - desc   : Describe the requested component.
	 - help   : Prints the help. Type help [command] for deatiled help.
	 - load   : Load a ZigZag script into the interpreter.
	 - ls     : List information related to the ZigZag script built.
	 - reset  : Resets the current constructed flow.
	 - search : Searches for any component and flow that match the query.
	 - save   : Save the flow built so far.
	 - quit   : Quits the console (same as ctr+D).
	 - version: Prints the version information.
	
* Hooked the ZigZag console to the compiler

* Started the ZigZag interpreter console.
	- Uses JLine for terminal emulation

* Moved the ZigZag compiler and runner to used jar-based MAUs
 
* Refactoring of the core to avoid intertwined dependencies and static factories

1.2vcli Panellet:

* Modified the Mau code generator of the ZigZag compiler to produce parallel component creation
	- Supports AUTO parallelization
	- Supports unforced and forced order maintenance 

* Extension to the ZigZag grammar to allow parallelization of instances (ordered and unordered)

* Fix to the add remove location WS (remove the corruption of descriptions problem identified by Boris)

* Implemented the MAU executor

* Integrated the semantic parser and MAU format generator

* Implemented the ZigZag compiler and parser

* Develop the ZigZag language

* (!!) Cummulative updates to the core
	- Better cleaning of webuis threads (a while ago Duane mention some apps with webuis were not finishing and this is the reason).
    - Fix to /admin/abort.txt of a webui (was leaving behind mr propper and thus not letting the flow to be destroyed), and
    -Webui now effectively also serve /public/resources (which will make AJAX easier so you can get the client pages form the webui /public/resources itself)

* (!!) Bug fixing
	- Fixed possible lost of data
	- Fixed out of order data sorting (violation of fairness of the underlying FSM that runs the component)
	- Toned down the login in the core
	
* WS additions
	- Boris added extra functionally on the queries for components and flows
	
* Bug fixing:
	- Fix the conductor to avoid crashing in the presence of dangling inputs
	- Forbid pushing nulls

* To the verbose flow execution WS:
	- Added parameter statistics
	- If true it dumps the flow execution statistics at the end of the run
	
* Created StatisticProbeImpl to gather general statistics about the flow execution
	- Store the basic statistics
	- Provides the results in JSON object

* Modified MrProbe to allow installing multiple probes

* Provenance and Python components
	- Modified the dispose method of JythonExecutableComponentAdapter (removed the nullification of the interpreter to allow MrProbe to clearly clean up)
	- The state serializations store the string representation of the locals() call
	- Functions are missing the code, but that code is already available on the embedded component context
	
* Meandre provenance infrastructure.
	- Added MeandreProbingVocabulary (native Meandre provenance dialect)
	- Implemented the MeandreRDFDialectProbeImpl
	- Tested and verified the spitted triples
	
* MrProbe merge against the Conductor, Executor, WrappedComponent, and ComponentContext
	- Modification to allow them to be probed
	- All the present engine tests passed for java only flows
	
* Added MrProbe class. This thread stands during the execution to gather information of the run
	- New class added MrProbe
	- New package org.meandre.core.engine.probes added
		* This package contains different implementations of the probe mechanisms
		* NullProbeImpl discards all the information
		* ToPrintStreamProbreImpl diverts all the info as text to the provided print stream

* Added cacheRefresh to the add/remove location services

* Modified the ComponentContextProperties to provide getFlowID function [Feb 16th 2008 by Amit Kumar]
	-Added the function implementation in ComponentContextImpl/Wrapped*Required/Conductor and WrappedComponents
	- This distinguishes getFlowID/getFlowExecutionID

* Modified the /services/repository/add and /services/repository/add_flow services
	- Added overwrite flag (if true overwrites the component/flow descriptor)
	- Added dump flag (if true dumps the repository after the requested modifications using the same format of requested modifications)

* Modified the ConductorTest to include the Python component.

* Added a Python component to the demo set
	- The component just turns a string to upper case (named To Uppercase)

* Modified the conductor to run embedded Python/Jython components
	- Python scripts are embedded contexts
	- Location should point to the component base URI
	- Multiple contexts (scripts can be attached)
	- There is no guarante about the order of scripts execution

* Passed the embedding test using the upgraded (see updates ExecutableContext) E2K demo components
	- Test demo and traditional context URIs work (Fixed a typo on the connector URI convention)
	- Test with all the embedded components

* (!!) Updated ExecutableContext. This change will break all components so far
	- initialize() changed to initialize(ComponentContextProperties ccp)
	- dispose() changed to dispose(ComponentContextPropoerties ccp)

* Root the ComponentContext in to the root interface ComponentContextProperties
	- ComponentContext presents the same API as before
	- ComponentContextProperties expose the subset of the original API not related to execution

* Created and tested the class JythonExecutableComponentAdapter
	- This class acts as an adapter
	- The adapter translate the ExcecutableComponent interface into it Jython counter part
	- The ComponentContext instance is accessible thanks to the Jython bindings
	- The Jython bindings turn getters/setters into pythonic assignable instance variables

* Created the new package subtree org.meandre.core.environments
	- This package is intended to group all non-java executable components
	- The package org.meandre.core.environments.python contains Python related environments
	- The package org.meandre.core.environments.python.jython contains the adapter to run Jython flavored executable components

* Modified the Conductor to allow embedding:
	- When preparing the URL class loader
	- If context is a resource pass the URI to the class loader
	- If context is a literal the content is dumped to /run/java with an encode name ending in .jar
	- Conductor implements a cache of the already dumped flows to boost up the preparation time (unless the hash code of the literal has changed)

* Modified the Repository beans to deal with RDFNodes
	- Old URI formats to contexts (jars) are expressed as Resources (external contexts)
	- Embeddable contexts (jars) are expressed as Literals
	- RDFNode homogenizes the use of contexts (external or embedded)

* (!!) Patched JENA to allow proper embedding:
	- Added case Text.CLOB to line 2238 in file DriverRDB.java to allow large literals in Derby
	- Hacked the derby.sql definition and replace the tail of the literal table to CLOB to allow long literals

* The add service modified:
	- jar parameter renamed as context
	- Added the embed check button for contexts

* Rework the repository implementation metadata processing
	- Moved from SPARQL prototypes to the equivalent procedural version using JENA API
	- Also used the indexer straight will manual filtering to boost search performance
	- Performance of the repository interaction hugely improved.
	- Remove the SPARQL injection problem on the full text search

* Modified the loggers to work on a rotating scheme
	- ./log dir destination of the loggers

* Added org.meandre.core.utils.vocabulary to contain all metadata relate vocabulary.
	- Add the repository one and patched the RepositoryImpl, ComponentDescriptionImpl, and FlowDescriptionImpl

* Moved the WSCoreBootstrapper from org.meandre in the src-kernel tree to org.meandre.webservices in the src-ws tree

* Main log file splitted:
	- The kernel logging goes to meandre-kerne.log file
	- The demo logging goes to meandre-demo.log file
	- The WS logging goes to meandre-webservices.log file

* WSCoreBootstrapper got moved to org.meandre.webservices.

* Source refactoring. Will broke:
	- ant
	- nbproject
