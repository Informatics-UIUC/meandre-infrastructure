1.2vcli Panellet:

* Trying to use the file indexer instead of the memory one, slow (?)

* Modified the loggers to work on a rotating scheme 
	- ./log dir destination of the loggers
	
* Added org.meandre.core.utils.vocabulary to contain all metadata relate vocabulary.
	- Add the repository one and patched the RepositoryImpl, ComponentDescriptionImpl, and FlowDescriptionImpl
	
* Moved the WSCoreBootstrapper from org.meandre in the src-kernel tree to org.meandre.webservices in the src-ws tree

* Main log file splitted:
	- The kernel logging goes to meandre-kerne.log file
	- The demo logging goes to meandre-demo.log file
	- The WS logging goes to meandre-webservices.log file

* WSCoreBootstrapper got moved to org.meandre.webservices.

* Source refactoring. Will broke:
	- ant
	- nbproject
