1.2vcli Panellet:

* (!) Patched JENA to allow proper embedding:
	- Added case Text.CLOB to line 2238 in file DriverRDB.java to allow large literals in Derby
	- Hacked the derby.sql definition and replace the tail of the literal table to CLOB to allow long literals
	
* The add service modified:
	- jar parameter renamed as context
	- Added the embed check button for contexts
	
* Rework the repository implementation metadata processing
	- Moved from SPARQL prototypes to the equivalent procedural version using JENA API
	- Also used the indexer straight will manual filtering to boost search performance
	- Performance of the repository interaction hugely improved.
	- Remove the SPARQL injection problem on the full text search

* Modified the loggers to work on a rotating scheme 
	- ./log dir destination of the loggers
	
* Added org.meandre.core.utils.vocabulary to contain all metadata relate vocabulary.
	- Add the repository one and patched the RepositoryImpl, ComponentDescriptionImpl, and FlowDescriptionImpl
	
* Moved the WSCoreBootstrapper from org.meandre in the src-kernel tree to org.meandre.webservices in the src-ws tree

* Main log file splitted:
	- The kernel logging goes to meandre-kerne.log file
	- The demo logging goes to meandre-demo.log file
	- The WS logging goes to meandre-webservices.log file

* WSCoreBootstrapper got moved to org.meandre.webservices.

* Source refactoring. Will broke:
	- ant
	- nbproject
